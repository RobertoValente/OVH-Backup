# OVH-Backup
Have you ever try to create an automatic way to backup your own snapshots from your [OVH Cloud](https://github.com/ovh) VPS? Well, me too. That's why I decided to create this project that uses a Raspberry Pi Zero W to create, get and download the snapshot to an external hard drive connected to the Raspberry!
